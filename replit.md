# Chat Widget Application

## Overview
A stand-alone chat widget built with React + Vite (Frontend) and Express + Socket.io (Backend). Designed to be embedded in an iframe on a WordPress site. Communicates with the parent window via `postMessage` for dynamic resizing. All UI is in Spanish.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React icons, Socket.io-client
- **Backend**: Express, Socket.io, Drizzle ORM, Resend (email)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for message, session, canned response, and contact request persistence
- **Theme**: Dark gaming aesthetic with neon purple (#6200EA) accents

## Key Features
1. **Widget States**: Launcher button (closed) + Chat window (open), with postMessage events (`open_chat`/`close_chat`) with dimensions for iframe resizing
2. **Auto-Authentication**: Reads `?email=` and `?name=` URL params for WordPress logged-in users
3. **Page Context Detection**: Reads `?page_url=` and `?page_title=` params, or receives page info via postMessage from parent, to provide contextual auto-replies
4. **Guest Form**: Welcome form (in Spanish) asking for email, problem type (dropdown), game/product name (searchable dropdown with live product search from catalog), and user name. Saves to localStorage with unique session ID
5. **Session-Based Privacy**: Each chat gets a unique session ID (generated client-side). Messages are stored/fetched by sessionId, not email. Email is only used for executive contact. This prevents users from seeing each other's chat history even if they enter the same email
6. **Hybrid Messaging**: HTTP POST for sending messages (iframe-compatible), Socket.io for real-time receiving, with 4s polling fallback
7. **Message Persistence**: All messages stored in PostgreSQL with session isolation, history loaded on reconnect within same session
8. **Contact Executive**: Button to request human contact, sends email notification via Resend to cjmdigitales@gmail.com with chat summary, page context, and pre-chat form data (problem type, game/product name)
9. **Smart Auto-replies**: Intelligent context-aware auto-reply engine (`server/autoReply.ts`) with conversation memory, intent detection (12 intent types), game/product name recognition (20+ titles including EA FC, GTA, COD, Spider-Man, etc.), no-repetition system, smart escalation to human agents after unresolved exchanges, and **consultation-type-adaptive greetings** (compra→shopping focus, entrega→delivery empathy, devolucion→executive redirect, problema_cuenta→support focus, info_producto→product info, precio→price display)
10. **Product Catalog**: Database-backed product catalog that the bot queries to include real prices, availability, and purchase URLs in responses. Managed via admin panel "Productos" tab. Purchase flow tracks stages (inquiry→confirmed→link) to avoid looping.
11. **Admin Panel** (`/admin`): Private admin page with session list, chat viewer, global search, status filters, tags, canned responses management, product catalog management, **session agent badges** (Bot/Ejecutivo/Solicita Ejecutivo), **agent type filter tabs**, and **admin product search/send** (search products from catalog and send formatted product messages directly to users)
12. **In-Chat Search**: Search bar within the chat window to filter messages within the current conversation, with text highlighting
13. **Conversation Status Management**: Sessions can be marked as 'active' or 'closed' (soft delete). Closed chats are hidden from inbox but accessible via filter. Auto-reopens when user sends new message.
14. **Slash Commands / Canned Responses**: Admin-only feature. Typing "/" in the admin reply input shows a dropdown of predefined quick responses. Managed via admin panel CRUD.
15. **Session Tags**: Conversations can be tagged (Venta, Soporte, Urgente, etc.) for categorization in the admin panel.
16. **Offline Email Notifications**: When a support reply is sent and the user is disconnected (no active Socket.io connection), an email notification is sent to the user via Resend.
17. **Admin Live Chat Takeover**: Admin can click "Entrar al Chat" to take over a conversation. Bot auto-replies are paused, admin gets a reply input to respond directly. User receives a notification message. Admin can click "Salir del Chat" to return control to the bot. Messages auto-refresh every 3s when admin is active.
18. **Image Uploads**: Both users and admins can send images in chat. Images are uploaded to Replit Object Storage via presigned URL flow. Messages with images display inline with clickable previews. Image-only messages skip auto-reply. Max file size: 5MB.
19. **In-Chat Product Browser**: ShoppingBag button in chat input opens a floating product catalog overlay with search. Users can browse/search products and click to send a product inquiry directly in the conversation.
20. **Satisfaction Survey**: When the bot detects the conversation is resolved (user says "gracias" or "adios"), it asks if the user wants to end the chat and rate their experience. Shows 1-5 star rating + optional comment. Ratings are stored in the database and visible in the admin panel with per-session ratings, average score, and comments.

21. **JWT Authentication**: Admin panel uses JWT-based email/password authentication instead of API key. Superadmin account (webmakerchile@gmail.com) is auto-seeded on startup. Users can change their own passwords. Superadmin can create/delete admin users.
22. **User Management**: Superadmin-only tab to create and delete admin users. Regular admins can access all features except user management.
23. **PWA (Progressive Web App)**: Admin panel is installable as "Soporte CJM DIGITALES" on mobile/desktop. Manifest.json with standalone display, service worker for push notifications, Apple/Android icons.
24. **Audio Notifications**: Web Audio API beep plays when new sessions appear (configurable via sound toggle in header).
25. **Push Notifications**: Browser push notifications via VAPID/web-push when admin has the app backgrounded. Subscription managed per admin user.

## WordPress Iframe Integration
Embed the widget with URL params:
```html
<iframe src="https://your-app.replit.app/?email=user@email.com&name=UserName&page_url=https://yoursite.com/page&page_title=Page Title&product_name=EA Sports FC 26&product_price=$29.99 USD&product_url=https://yoursite.com/product/fc-26&product_image=https://yoursite.com/img/fc26.jpg" />
```
Product-specific params (optional, for product pages):
- `product_name` - Name of the product on the current page
- `product_price` - Price of the product
- `product_url` - Direct link to buy the product
- `product_image` - Product image URL
The widget sends postMessage events to the parent for resize:
```js
{ type: "open_chat", width: 390, height: 600 }
{ type: "close_chat", width: 70, height: 70 }
```

## Resend Setup Note
For production email delivery, you need to verify a domain in Resend. The free tier onboarding@resend.dev sender only delivers to the Resend account owner's email. To send to any email, add and verify your domain in Resend dashboard.
